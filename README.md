# Pirate Intelligent Agent – CS 370

## Project Overview
This project focuses on applying deep reinforcement learning to a real-world problem. The goal was to train a pirate agent to navigate a grid-based map and find hidden treasure using a deep Q-learning algorithm. 

The environment setup was provided. I built the neural network model, designed the training loop, implemented the decision-making logic, and tuned the reward system to guide the agent's learning. The project challenged me to combine theory and application, moving beyond just understanding reinforcement learning to actually making it work in a real scenario.

## Reflection

### What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists solve real-world problems by building systems, algorithms, and software that push industries forward. What we create impacts everything from healthcare to transportation to entertainment. Good design and smart problem-solving aren't just technical skills—they shape how technology improves people’s lives.

### How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
I break problems down into smaller parts, look at them from different angles, and create logical, structured solutions. It's about balancing clean design with real-world limitations, being flexible when things don't go as planned, and always working toward something functional and efficient.

### What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
The responsibility doesn't stop at making something that works. It's about making something that's secure, reliable, and fair. Users should trust the systems we build, and organizations should know we're thinking about long-term impacts, not just short-term wins. Ethics has to stay at the core of what we create—privacy, transparency, and putting users first.
